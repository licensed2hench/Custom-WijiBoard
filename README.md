## What is the original WijiBoard?

The **WijiBoard** is a unique, remote-controlled interactive board that lets you move a planchette using WiFi, Bluetooth, or a web interface. It combines hands-on electronics with fun, supernatural-inspired functionality, providing a fascinating way to learn hardware, programming, and PCB design.

To see it in action, check out our [YouTube video](https://youtu.be/cnTcyXp5cuc?si=UInx9ra7MZg4BWGi) where we explore WijiBoardâ€™s features and give a demonstration!

I am atemptong to modify the files of this project to exspand the **WijiBoard** fuctionality.
Goals:
Add the ability to trasmit fill string of text. Currently it can only do one letter at a time, not accepting a new input untill after the old input cycle is completed.
Add more "Hot Key" words and phrases. so that more coplex behavor can be automated with a single command
Add Home Assistant intagration, so that home assistant can triger pe-programes sequences and idealy, send text.

## Current Issues

As of 7/31/25: 
PlatformIO has been having issues compiling for esp32 chipset. Somewhere an update broke one of the librarys / repositories. This may delay the project.
ESPHome via Home Assistant Addon is working with a manual "use older library" work around. But the idea of rewriting all of this code in yaml format is intimidating.
Currenly I have lost access to the original video tutorial. I will see if I can recover that and review.

## Components Used

- ESP32 Microcontroller (recommended)
- Stepper Motors
- Custom PCB (included in this repo)
